            <h3>A noob to be Web Developer </h3>
            <p>Web development is fun if you know how to do it. My daughter has a high potential of becoming a web
                developer
                even if not a professional. I am teaching her from the early stage of her life. Guess her age! She is 6
                months
                old. </p>

            <p>I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how
                to make simple
                website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I didn't
                    stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know
                    the
                    deployment,
                    server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
